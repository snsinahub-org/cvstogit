# Committers

The following people had commit access to cvs2svn when it was in
Subversion. This is not a full list of cvs2svn's authors, however —
for that, you'd need to look over the log messages to see all the
patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, please go to
https://github.com/mhagger/cvs2svn, rather than mailing any of these
people directly.
